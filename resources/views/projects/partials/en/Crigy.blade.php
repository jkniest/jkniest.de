        The video game "Crigy" was developed for the Ludum-Dare competition. Goal at the Ludum-Dare is
        to create a video game within 72 hours, according to a specific theme. The topic will be published at the start.
        This time it was: "Running out of Power".
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The game plays in an abandoned factory. You slip into the role of a robot that runs out of energy. The goal of
        the game is to activate the ultimate generator in order to generate unlimited energy for yourself and all
        other robots.
    </p>
    <p>
        But beware: Other robots want the whole energy for themself and they want your energy. They will attack you
        and you must defend yourself!

        <h4 class="title is-4">Animations / Finetuning</h4>

            All robots and weapons are fully animated. They have shot and motion animations.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Soundeffects / Music</h4>

        <p>
            The whole game has two soundtracks and all actions have inidividual sound effects. Various generators
            and tools were used for the creation. Overall, this greatly increased the mood in the game and makes this
            much more real.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Energy</h4>

        <p>
            The player loses energy. If an enemy hurts him, a part of his own energy is sucked off. After each empty
            space, there is a battery that charges some of its own energy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If there is no energy left, the game has been lost.

    <h3 class="title is-3">Development</h3>

    <p>
        The game was developed with the <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity3D Engine</a>. The game can be found on
        <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/crigy/273314">Gamejolt</a>. There is a Windows-, Mac-, Linux- and
        Webversion available.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The game was developed and modeled within 72 hours. I have done the programming. The models and sound effects
        were created by Markus Kapp, a friend of mine.

    <h3 class="title is-3">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
        The game has become a lot harder than we thought. Overall it feels ready through the sound effects, the music
        and all the animations.
