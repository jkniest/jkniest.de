    <p>
        The mini-game "Planet of the Elements" was developed for a game competition within 50 hours by two people.
        The player has the goal to kill enemies appering in waves without dying himself.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        These enemies drop coins that the player can use in shops to buy random items and weapons. There are almost
        20 different items and five different weapons.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Random items</h4>

        <p>
            There are almost 20 different items, all of which can be combined and interacted with. Some of the items
            must be used manually, while others have a continuous effect, such as attribute increases (speed, damage,
            etc.) or additional effects such as fire damage.
        </p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Enemys / Waves</h4>

        <p>
            A total of three enemies with completely different behaviors randomly spawn in waves in the world. One
            enemy is inactive until the players come near to it. Another enemy makes poison damage. Each wave is
            more difficult than the previous one, because on the one hand the enemies become stronger, but also more
            enemies appear.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Shops / Chests</h4>

        <p>
            Within the level are some shops and chests. For a certain amount, you can buy random items or weapons
            there.

    <h3 class="title is-3">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
        The development of this game was a lot of fun. We also came to the second round of the competition, but for
        reasons of time we had to cancel the project and leave the competition.
