        The video game "Mission: Delta-8x34" was developed for the Ludum-Dare Competition. Goal at the Ludum-Dare is
        to create a video game within 48 hours, according to a specific theme. The topic will be published at the start
        of the 48 hours. This time it was: "Small worlds".
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The player slips into the role of a space engineer. He has the task of repairing a military satellite on a
        "micro-world" since it has not sent any signals for several days.

    <h3 class="title is-3">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
        I think this is my first game, which feels complete and ready. There are soundeffects, a clear goal, several
        missions and an end. Add to that a simple story. I also like the art style very well.
