        The Unity3D game "Defend the Base" was developed within 30 hours for the Ludum-Dare competition. The player
        controls a turret and must defeat enemies, coming from all sides, before they reach the tower.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The player can always improve and buy upgrades, such as rocket launchers, lasers or event additional automated
        turrets.

        <p>
            The player gets a little money through each defeated enemy. Of this money he can buy improvements, such
            as faster shooting speed. But also completely new defense measures can be bought, such as a rocket launcher,
            a laser system or even up to four additional, fully automated, turrets.

        <p>
            There are four different enemies coming from all sides. Some shoot their own projectiles. The longer the
            player plays, the heavier enemies appear.

    <h3 class="title is-3">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
        The game is far from finished. The graphics needs to be redone and all sounds are missing. But I think for
        30 hours, it has become a funny, short game. Also some comments from other players have confirmed this.
